### 🧩 About Me

I’m a **Computer Engineer** focused on building **end-to-end AI systems** — from data processing and model training to deployment, demos, and real-world integration.

My work spans **Computer Vision, NLP, recommender systems, and applied machine learning**, with a strong emphasis on **engineering complete, usable systems**, not just isolated experiments.

I enjoy turning complex technical ideas into **clean, practical products**.
