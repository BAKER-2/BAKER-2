## 👋 Hi, I’m Baker

[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0A66C2?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baker-husein/)

I'm a Computer Engineering specialist building end-to-end AI systems—from computer vision pipelines to NLP models, real-time analytics, and intelligent automation tools. I enjoy taking complex technical ideas and turning them into clean, practical, working products.

Right now I’m focused on:

- 🧠 AI & ML, CV, NLP, segmentation models, classical ML
- 🛰️ Computer Vision, U-Net pipelines, mask generation, image processing
- 🔤 NLP, text classification, moderation models, vectorization
- ⚡ Systems & Pipelines,  end-to-end engineering, JSON workflows, Unity integrations
- 🎮 Interactive Tech, AI-assisted level generation & game tools
- 📊 Data Science, supervised classification, clustering, feature selection

**What I’ve Built**

- _Sketch-to-Level Generator_
AI & CV pipeline that converts hand-drawn maps into fully playable Unity levels using U-Net segmentation, synthetic data generation, and procedural instantiation.
- _Astronomical Object Classifier_
Machine learning system that classifies SDSS STAR/GALAXY/QSO objects using photometric features, achieving 97% accuracy with ensemble models.
- _Tweet Moderation (NPL-Based)_
NLP pipeline for flagging harmful and offensive tweets using preprocessing, perplexity scoring, and downstream classification.

(More projects coming soon)
